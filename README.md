# To-Do List w/ jQuery

### Introduction
A simple to-do list as practice for using jQuery.

Goal:
- [x] enter new activity to the list by entering it into the text input
- [x] delete listed activities by clicking on the \[X]'s
- [x] strike-through "completed" activity by clicking on them (to remain on list)

### To-Do List
###### (for the To-Do List. ha ha. good joke.)
- [x] Add intended functionality
- *extra functionality*
	- [x] Modify text input to prevent code injection
	- [x] The "delete" button on each Activity appears when hovered over
	- [x] The text input appears/disappears when the 'pencil & note' icon is clicked
- [x] Make it pretty
- [x] \(Optional) Add stuff to to-do list if I think of more stuff to add 
- [ ] \(Optional) Save To-Do List (maybe Node.JS back-end with accounts or cookies or both)
