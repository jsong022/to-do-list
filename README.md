#To-Do List w/ jQuery

###Introduction
A simple to-do list as practice for using jQuery.

Goal:
- [x] enter new activity to the list by entering it into the text input
- [x] delete listed activities by clicking on the \[X]'s
- [x] strike-through "completed" activity by clicking on them (to remain on list)

###To-Do List

- *extra functionality*
	- [x] Modify text input to prevent code injection
- [ ] Make it pretty
- [ ] \(Optional) Add stuff to to-do list if I think of more stuff to add
